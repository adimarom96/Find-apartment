# Find-apartment
I created the project with the goal of making the "find apartment" process easy. The main idea was to collect data from serval rent site and carte one big
data center for all those apartments.
One feature that makes the system special is the calculation of the distance and time of the apartment from the university.

In this project, I used the BeautifulSoup library to extract the data from the In literature, process the data, and insert it to Pandas DF.
To calculate the distance and the time from university I used Google Maps Platform.
.
The next step was to create a user interface that allows the user ask queries and look for apartment in a convenient way- for this
I used the Kivy library.
